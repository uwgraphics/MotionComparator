Motion Comparator is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) using [React](https://react.dev/) and [rc-dock](https://github.com/ticlo/rc-dock) â€“ contributions are welcome!

## Credits
Motion Comparator draws a lot of design inspiration from robot visualization tools, especially [Foxglove Studio](https://github.com/foxglove/studio) and [Webviz](https://github.com/cruise-automation/webviz). The teaser image is generated by AI using NightCafe Studio.
